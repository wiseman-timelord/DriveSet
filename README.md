# DriveSet-Psc
Status: ALPHA (do not use).

## Work Done
- Batch conformed from NetOptMon-Psc, or whatever its name will end up being.
- Figured out folders to use.

## Work TODO
- it should check if any of the drives have been mapped to the locations before each submenu loads.
- menu items on submenus will have displayed the Status displayed as what selecting the options would toggle, for example "1 = WSL Ubuntu (Assign/Release)" for relevantly  Un-asigned or Assigned folders. The user will now be toggling assignments on the submenu items. 
- new option Refresh "Screen=R" to, re-check drive letter assignments and refresh the menu.
- we will no longer need a ".\scripts\drives.psd1", so update the parts relevant to that.
- remember to keep significant variables at the start of the script, but not, menus or headers. 
- the Choose-Profile should be the first option on the Main Menu, with its own submenu that should be displaying the available profiles.
- Milestones: Complete Menus, Optimize & Improve layout, Final Testing & Fixing.
